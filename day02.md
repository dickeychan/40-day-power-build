1️⃣ Philosophy – Aristotle
Core Idea

Virtue is not knowledge.
Virtue is a trained habit.

We do not become good by knowing what is good.
We become good by repeatedly doing good actions.

“We become just by doing just acts.”

Golden Mean (中庸之道)

Every virtue lies between two extremes.

Example:

Courage = not recklessness, not cowardice

Integrity = not naive, not manipulative

Virtue requires balance guided by reason.

Personal Reflection

I want to become a person who is:

Wise (able to judge under uncertainty)

Decisive

Reliable

Persistent

I understand now that these are not traits I “have” —
they are traits I must repeatedly practice.

2️⃣ Telos (終極目標)

Aristotle believed humans have a telos:
Eudaimonia — living a fulfilled and excellent life.

AI optimizes for accuracy.

I am optimizing for:

Leadership ability

Work capability

Mental strength

Character development

AI has no purpose.
I do.

3️⃣ Habits I Will Train Daily

Character is formed by repetition.

Daily reinforcement:

Fixed gym sessions (discipline of body)

1 hour no-phone deep focus (discipline of mind)

Before sending important emails, ask:
→ “Does this push the matter forward?”

Intentionally help one colleague progress (without seeking credit)

These habits shape reliability and integrity.

4️⃣ Leadership Insight

Integrity is long-term leverage.

Principles must remain stable.
Strategies can evolve.

True leadership:

Explains the WHY

Builds systems that protect values

Allows others to grow

I aim to become:

A leader who sees clearly, decides calmly, and stands firmly.

And ultimately:

A person whose growth multiplies the growth of others.

5️⃣ Key Realization of Today

Character is not a decision.
It is a pattern.
