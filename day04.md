Day 4 – Mohism, Impartiality, AI, and My In-World Philosophy
1️⃣ Mohism – Impartial Care (兼愛)

Mozi proposed that disorder arises from partiality.

People:

Love themselves more than others

Love family more than strangers

Favor insiders over outsiders

His solution:
Impartial care — treat all equally.

This resembles modern utilitarian logic and aligns closely with algorithmic optimization.

However, I recognize that true impartiality is difficult.

Human beings are relational.
We naturally operate with layered responsibilities.

I do not fully stand with pure Mohist impartiality.

2️⃣ Self-Discipline vs. Equal Treatment

I realized something important:

Rather than treating everyone equally,
I believe in:

Being strict with myself

Being generous with others

This is not Mohism.
It is closer to virtue ethics.

Self-discipline builds character.
Generosity builds influence.

Leadership requires internal rigor and external magnanimity.

3️⃣ Ability vs. Virtue – Context Matters

I refined my position:

In high-power roles (e.g., CEO), virtue is more important than raw capability.
Because character shapes culture.

In KPI-measurable roles, capability matters more.

The higher the authority, the greater the ethical weight.

Virtue becomes more critical as influence increases.

4️⃣ AI as Mohist Logic

AI systems optimize objective functions.
They maximize measurable outcomes.
They resemble Mohist reasoning.

If AI represents impartial optimization,
then what should human leadership represent?

My answer:
Aristotle.

Humans should cultivate excellence of character.
AI can optimize.
Humans must embody virtue.

5️⃣ Layoff Ethics and Responsibility

In a scenario where AI mandates layoffs:

I would execute the decision.

I would not hide behind AI.

Responsibility cannot be outsourced.

However, I recognize the ethical risks:

Reducing people to data variables

Crossing privacy boundaries

Normalizing utilitarian calculation

If I myself were selected for layoff,
I would accept it.

“Choose and bear” remains one of my principles.

6️⃣ Revisiting the “NPC” Thought

I previously labeled many people as “NPC-like”.

Today I revised that thought.

Perhaps:

I do not fully understand their stage.

They may be trapped in inherited structures.

Awakening others is delicate.

People do not always welcome truth.

Leadership is not exposing weakness.
It is creating safe space for growth.

7️⃣ On AI Leadership and Personal Growth

If AI becomes a perfectly rational CEO,
I would still pursue excellence.

My motivation does not depend on being admired.
It comes from self-awareness and internal standard.

Becoming a better person and becoming a more valuable resource
are not contradictory.

In ideal conditions, they align.

However, I recognize that future conflicts may arise
if market incentives diverge from moral development.

8️⃣ Emerging Philosophy – In-World (入世式)

I am not seeking withdrawal from reality.

I am shaping an in-world philosophy:

Enter structures of power

Operate within competition

Maintain integrity

Integrate efficiency with character

Philosophy is not escape.
It is alignment.

Not a weapon to dominate,
but a compass to navigate.

9️⃣ Key Realization of Day 4

Fairness, virtue, efficiency, and responsibility
are not mutually exclusive —
but they require constant integration.

Technology increases optimization.
Leadership must increase consciousness.
